Upgrade from Alpha 1 to Alpha2
==============================

Metadata Document representation changed
----------------------------------------

The Metadata representation of Doctrine mapped CouchDB documents changed significantly.
To migrate your old data you have to call:

    php doctrine-couchdb.php couchdb:migrate "Doctrine\ODM\CouchDB\Tools\Migrations\Alpha2Migration"

To make this work you have to put your own doctrine-couchdb.php in your project. You can copy
it from bin/ or sandbox/ folders of the CouchDB migration. Make sure to also ship a cli-config.php
script like shown in the sandbox/cli-config.php
